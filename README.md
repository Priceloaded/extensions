Bullshark Quests is a program where Bullshark holders can earn rewards (directly or through partners), including SUI and other perks. Each Quest will have different participating applications, actions, and reward criteria.
There are two reward pools of 2.5M SUI, for a total of 5M SUI provided by the Sui Foundation. The first pool will be shared by the top 10,000 eligible players. The second pool will be divided equally among all other eligible players.

The table below provides an outline for rewards for the first pool for top 10,000 eligible players.
Top player Pool
Rank	SUI Reward
1	34,050
2-10	24,000
11-100	5,555
101-1,000	500
1,001-5,000	200
5,001-10,000	100

The table below outlines an example of rewards for the second pool. Participants can get up to 90 SUI from the General Pool. The exact amount per participant will depend on the total number of eligible players at the end of the Quest period. Please note that U.S. citizens and residents are ineligible to receive SUI token rewards.

How do people participate in Bullshark Quests?
To participate and be eligible for rewards, you must:
Hold at least one Bullshark for the entire duration of your active Quest period, until the promotion period ends.
Play all four games featured at least once during the Quest period (but the more you play, the more points you earn!). Mount Sogol is an exception where you just have to play it at least once, even if it happened prior to the promotion period.
At any time, you may check your score and rank on the Bullshark Quest portal.
Employees and directors of Mysten Labs and the Sui Foundation, contest partners and advisors, and the immediate family (parent, child, sibling, and spouse of each) or members of the households of such employees and directors are not eligible to receive rewards in the contest.
A reminder that once you become eligible by owning a Bullshark, you must continue to hold at least one or more Bullsharks until the Quest period ends–otherwise it’s an automatic disqualifier. Participation is subject to additional restrictions and requirements, including accepting the terms and conditions for the Bullshark Quest.# extensions
